# xmas-quest

### [Archived as of 12/25/2021]

This is a quest to play on Christmas eve.
The quest was made in 2020 and has questions about it. You can easily edit them and create new ones, though.

All you need to do is to make an HTML page and place it in `templates` directory. Also, in `main.py` file, please place the id of the questions onto lines 51 and 224. Finally, add the id of the question into the form of `new_room.html`. That's it :)

ps. Please, sorry for long loading of the page üôè
